## Overview
CMI is a machine learning-based system designed to predict **Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors (BFRBs)** using sensor data from a wrist-worn device. By analyzing movement patterns and physiological signals, the model identifies signs of BFRBs and helps users gain insights into their behavioral tendencies.

## Features
- **Real-time behavior detection** using wrist sensor data.
- **Machine learning-based prediction models** for BFRBs.
- **User-friendly interface** for monitoring behavioral trends.
- **Data visualization** for easy interpretation of results.

## Installation
To set up the environment, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/CMI-Detect-Behavior.git
cd CMI-Detect-Behavior
pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage
- Collect sensor data using the wrist-worn device.
- Preprocess the data and format it for analysis.
- Run the prediction model:
python detect_behavior.py --input data/sensor_readings.csv


- View the detected patterns and predicted behaviors.
Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy & Pandas for data processing
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow for machine learning
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Sensor integration libraries
